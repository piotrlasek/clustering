# Data clustering algorithms library.

The list of implemented algorithms includes:

* DBSCAN
* NBC
* k-Means
* TI_DBSCAN (DBSCAN using Triangle Inequality Property for determining eps-neighbourhoods)
* TI_NBC (NBC with Triangle Inequality Property for determining k nearest neighbours)
* ic-DBSCAN (DBSCAN with instance constraints)
* ic-NBC (NBC with instance constraints)
* r-DBSCAN (DBSCAN with relative constraints)
* r-NBC (NBC with relative constraints)
